### Common Testing Patterns Quick Reference

#### Basic Function Test Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_function_success(self):
    context = {'input': 'test_data'}
    result = await your_function(context)
    assert result['expected_output'] == 'expected_value'
```

#### Chain Test Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_chain_execution(self):
    workflow = chain([function_one, function_two, function_three])
    context = self.create_test_context()
    result = await workflow(context)
    assert result['final_stage_complete'] is True
```

#### Mock External Service Pattern
```python
@patch('your_module.external_service')
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_with_mock(self, mock_service):
    mock_service.call.return_value = {'status': 'success'}
    result = await your_function(context)
    mock_service.call.assert_called_once()
```

#### Error Testing Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_error_handling(self):
    with pytest.raises(ExpectedError, match="error message"):
        await your_function(invalid_context)
```

#### Parametrized Test Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
    ("valid_input", True),
    ("invalid_input", False),
])
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_multiple_inputs(self, input, expected):
    result = await your_function({'data': input})
    assert result['is_valid'] == expected
```

## Real-World Examples

Based on our comprehensive testing work, here are proven patterns:

### DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Testing
- **570+ lines of test code** covering complete CI/CD workflows
- **Unit tests** for individual pipeline functions (checkout, build, test, deploy)
- **Integration tests** for complete pipeline chains
- **Environment-specific tests** for dev/staging/production
- **Failure scenario tests** for error handling and rollback
- **Performance tests** for pipeline execution time

### Financial Trading System Testing  
- **400+ lines of test code** covering trading workflows
- **Risk management tests** ensuring dangerous trades are prevented
- **Compliance tests** verifying regulatory requirements
- **Market data tests** with realistic trading scenarios
- **Portfolio management tests** for position tracking

### Key Insights from Real Testing

1. **Start with Prerequisites** - Many complex workflows fail because prerequisites aren't met
2. **Mock External Services** - Don't test your code with real APIs, databases, or external systems
3. **Test Error Conditions** - Spend as much time testing failure cases as success cases
4. **Use Realistic Data** - Test with data that resembles production scenarios
5. **Test Performance Early** - Don't wait until production to discover performance issues

## Debugging Test Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Tests Pass Individually but Fail Together
**Problem:** State leakage between tests  
**Solution:** Use proper setup/teardown or fixtures

```python
def setup_method(self):
    """Reset state before each test."""
    reset_global_state()
    clear_caches()
```

#### Flaky Tests (Intermittent Failures)
**Problem:** Timing issues or external dependencies  
**Solution:** Use mocks and control timing

```python
# Instead of real delays
await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Flaky

# Use controlled mocks
with patch('asyncio.sleep'):
    result = await your_function()  # Reliable
```

#### Slow Test Execution
**Problem:** Tests take too long to run  
**Solution:** Use mocks and parallelize

```bash
# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto  # Requires pytest-xdist
```

#### Hard to Understand Test Failures
**Problem:** Poor error messages  
**Solution:** Use descriptive assertions

```python
# Poor
assert result['status']

# Better  
assert result['status'] is True, f"Expected success but got: {result}"
```

## Best Practices Summary

### 1. **Test Structure**
- Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
- One assertion per test concept
- Descriptive test names
- Independent tests

### 2. **Test Data**
- Use factories for consistent data
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
- Use parametrized tests for multiple scenarios

### 3. **Mocking Strategy**
- Mock external dependencies
- Mock at the right level (not too deep)
- Verify mock interactions
- Use realistic mock responses

### 4. **Error Testing**
- Test expected errors
- Test unexpected error handling
- Test error recovery mechanisms
- Test rollback procedures

### 5. **Performance Considerations**
- Set execution time expectations
- Test memory usage
- Test concurrent execution
- Monitor test execution trends

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- **Test Coverage** - Aim for >80% line coverage
- **Test Execution Time** - Keep unit tests <1s, integration <10s
- **Test Reliability** - <1% flaky test rate
- **Bug Detection Rate** - Tests should catch bugs before production

### Regular Maintenance
- Review and update test data regularly
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor common test patterns
- Update mocks when external APIs change

## Getting Help

### Common Questions

**Q: How many tests do I need?**  
A: Focus on quality over quantity. Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions for critical workflows.

**Q: Should I test private functions?**  
A: Generally no. Test public interfaces and let implementation details be covered indirectly.

**Q: How do I test async workflows?**  
A: Use `pytest-asyncio` and mark test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

**Q: When should I mock vs use real services?**  
A: Mock for unit tests, consider real services for integration tests in test environments.

### Next Steps

1. **Start Small** - Begin with the beginner cookbook and basic patterns
2. **Practice Regularly** - Write tests for your actual workflows
3. **Learn from Examples** - Study the DevOps and Financial examples
4. **Iterate and Improve** - Refactor tests as you learn better patterns
5. **Share Knowledge** - Help others learn by documenting your patterns

Remember: Good tests are an investment in code quality, team confidence, and system reliability. They're worth the effort!
